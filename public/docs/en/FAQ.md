### 1. I currently have a ready-to-use DeepSeek API Key. Can I use it with Claude Code?

> Of course! That's exactly what we're doing here. If you wish to use it for Claude Code, simply select Anthropic as the target provider. Not only DeepSeek API, but any API compatible with the OpenAI interface specification can be used. For details, please refer to the documentation.

### 2. How many adapters can I create at most simultaneously?

> Currently, free users are allowed a maximum quota of 3 adapters. If you need to create more, please contact us or stay tuned for further development updates.

### 3. Why are there multiple selectable options available for the same target provider?

> This is because the provider proxy services are deployed in different regions or countries. Please make your selection based on your specific usage scenario.

### 4. I've provided sensitive data such as my API Key. Will there be security concerns?

> No, there won't be! The API credential data you provide will only be used for service requests. We do not process, use, or disclose it for any other purpose. As a relay service provider, we do not store, analyze, or use the content of API requestsâ€”except to forward them to their intended destination. Furthermore, when you stop using this service, you may actively request data deletion.
