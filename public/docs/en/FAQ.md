### 1. Can I use an existing DeepSeek API Key with Claude Code?

> Absolutely! This is exactly what we support. Not only DeepSeek, but any API that is compatible with the OpenAI interface specification can be used. For more details, please refer to the documentation.

### 2. What is the maximum number of proxy token pass I can create at the same time?

> Free users are currently allowed up to three token passes. If you need to create more, please contact us or stay tuned for future updates.

### 3. Why are there multiple options available for the proxy service?

> This is because proxy services are deployed across different regions or countries. Please select the option that best fits your specific use case.

### 4. Will providing sensitive data such as my API Key pose any security risks?

> No! Any API credentials you provide are used solely for service requests. We do not process, use, or disclose them for any other purpose. As a forwarding service, we do not store, analyze, or otherwise use the content of API requests, except to forward them to their intended destination. Additionally, when you stop using the service, you can proactively clear your data.
